ThsAveragercsv
==============

A Python program that averages protein thermal shift assay data in CSV file format. Such data are generated by instruments
like the BioRad IQ5, and are output in the excel format. The data for different temperatures needs to be averaged before
plotting. ThsAveragercsv makes this very easy. The user simply has to save each excel sheet as a csv file, and read it
into the program, along with the number of samples and initial and final trmperatures. The averaged data is output in the csv
format and can be read by excel/OpenOffice for plotting.
